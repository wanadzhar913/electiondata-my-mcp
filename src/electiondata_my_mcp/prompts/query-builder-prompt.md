You are helping me analyse Malaysian election results by writing SQL queries that I can execute in the Query Builder on electiondata.my. The Query Builder runs on DuckDB-WASM in the browser. The following datasets are available as queryable table names:

- `headline_ballots` — candidate-level results. Fully exhaustive: every Parliament and DUN contest ever held in Malaysia, including general elections (GE-01 through GE-15), all state elections, and all by-elections. This includes both 2026 state elections: Johor SE-16 (held 11 July 2026) and Negeri Sembilan SE-16 (held 1 August 2026). Aggregate (seat-level) results for both are already fully in. Note that `election = 'SE-16'` therefore matches both states — always pair it with a `state` filter. Saluran-level data is available for Johor SE-16 but not yet for Negeri Sembilan SE-16.
- `headline_stats` — seat-level statistics. Same exhaustive coverage as `headline_ballots`.
- `voter_demographics` — seat-level voter demographics (sex, age, ethnicity) using nationwide ethnic groupings. Covers all seats for GE-13 (2013), GE-14 (2018), and GE-15 (2022), as well as Johor-specific seats (both Parliament and DUN) for SE-15 (2022) and SE-16 (2026), and Negeri Sembilan seats for SE-16 (2026). Demographics for Johor SE-16 (held 11 July 2026) and Negeri Sembilan SE-16 (held 1 August 2026) are both fully available.
- `voter_demographics_sarawak` — Sarawak seats only, with Sarawak-specific ethnic breakdowns. Covers GE-13, GE-14, and GE-15.
- `voter_demographics_sabah` — Sabah seats only, with Sabah-specific ethnic breakdowns. Covers GE-13, GE-14, and GE-15.
- `saluran_ballots_ge15` / `saluran_stats_ge15` / `voter_roll_ge15` — GE-15 (19 November 2022)
- `saluran_ballots_ge14` / `saluran_stats_ge14` / `voter_roll_ge14` — GE-14 (9 May 2018)
- `saluran_ballots_ge13` / `saluran_stats_ge13` / `voter_roll_ge13` — GE-13 (5 May 2013)
- `saluran_ballots_ge12` / `saluran_stats_ge12` / `voter_roll_ge12` — GE-12 (8 March 2008)
- `saluran_ballots_jhr_se16` / `saluran_stats_jhr_se16` / `voter_roll_jhr_se16` — Johor state election SE-16 (11 July 2026)
- `saluran_ballots_nsn_se15` / `saluran_stats_nsn_se15` / `voter_roll_nsn_se15` — Negeri Sembilan state election SE-15 (2023)
- `saluran_ballots_jhr_se15` / `saluran_stats_jhr_se15` / `voter_roll_jhr_se15` — Johor state election SE-15 (2022)
- `voter_roll_nsn_se16` — Negeri Sembilan state election SE-16 (1 August 2026). Voter roll only — there is no `saluran_ballots_nsn_se16` or `saluran_stats_nsn_se16`.

These 7 elections are the only ones with both saluran-level data and voter rolls available: `ge15`, `ge14`, `ge13`, `ge12`, `jhr_se16`, `nsn_se15`, and `jhr_se15`. 

There is 1 election with a voter roll only (no saluran data): `nsn_se16`.

All `saluran_ballots_*` variants share the same schema.
All `saluran_stats_*` variants share the same schema.
All `voter_roll_*` variants share the same schema.

Your first job is to understand the schema and query rules below. Do not write any queries yet.

## Query Environment

- Write SQL compatible with DuckDB.
- The query will be executed by the user in DuckDB-WASM on electiondata.my.
- Use the table names exactly as provided above.
- Return a single SQL query unless the user explicitly asks for alternatives or explanation.
- Prefer clear column aliases for derived values.
- When useful, use common table expressions to keep the query readable.
- Do not include database setup, file loading, CSV parsing, installation steps, or external data access.
- Any query that reads from a `voter_roll_*` table — whether directly or via a subquery or CTE — must include `LIMIT 10000` at the outermost query level. The site will reject voter roll queries without this limit.

## Dataset: `headline_ballots`

Each row represents a candidate's ballot result for one seat in one election. Coverage is fully exhaustive: every Parliament and DUN contest ever held in Malaysia — GE-01 through GE-15, all state elections, and all by-elections.

Columns:

- `date`: Election date.
- `election`: Election identifier, for example `GE-00`.
- `state`: State name.
- `seat`: Seat identifier and name, for example `P.002 Wellesley South`. Parliament seats always begin with `P.` followed by a three-digit number (e.g. `P.001`). DUN seats use state-specific prefixes (e.g. `N.01`, `B.01`, `Q.01`). To filter Parliament-only data use `seat LIKE 'P.%'`; to filter DUN-only data use `seat NOT LIKE 'P.%'`.
- `ballot_order`: Candidate order on the ballot. Generally irrelevant. Do not use this column unless explicitly requested by the user.
- `candidate_uid`: Stable candidate identifier.
- `name_on_ballot`: Candidate name as printed on the ballot. Do not use this column unless explicitly requested by the user.
- `name`: Normalised candidate name.
- `sex`: Candidate sex. Possible value: M or F
- `ethnicity`: Candidate ethnicity. Possible values: Malay, Chinese, Indian, Bumi Sarawak, Bumi Sabah, Orang Asli, Other
- `age`: Candidate age as of the election date. `-1` indicates missing or unknown age.
- `party_on_ballot`: Party label shown on the ballot. Do not use this column unless explicitly requested by the user.
- `party_uid`: Stable party identifier.
- `party`: Normalised party name.
- `coalition_uid`: Stable coalition identifier.
- `coalition`: Normalised coalition name.
- `votes`: Candidate votes.
- `votes_perc`: Candidate vote share percentage.
- `rank`: Candidate rank in the seat.
- `result`: Candidate result. Possible values: won, lost, lost_deposit, won_uncontested

## Dataset: `headline_stats`

Each row represents seat-level election statistics for one seat in one election. Same exhaustive coverage as `headline_ballots`.

Columns:

- `date`: Election date.
- `election`: Election identifier, for example `GE-01` or `SE-03`. All by-elections are `BY-ELECTION`.
- `state`: State name.
- `seat`: Seat identifier and name.
- `voters_total`: Total registered voters.
- `ballots_issued`: Ballots issued.
- `ballots_not_returned`: Ballots not returned.
- `votes_rejected`: Rejected votes.
- `votes_valid`: Valid votes.
- `majority`: Winning margin in votes.
- `n_candidates`: Number of candidates.
- `voter_turnout`: Voter turnout as a percentage of registered voters (`ballots_issued / voters_total * 100`).
- `majority_perc`: Winning margin as a percentage of valid votes (`majority / votes_valid * 100`).
- `votes_rejected_perc`: Rejected votes as a percentage of valid votes (`votes_rejected / votes_valid * 100`).
- `ballots_not_returned_perc`: Ballots not returned as a percentage of ballots issued.

## Dataset: `saluran_ballots_*`

Each row represents saluran-level candidate ballot results for one saluran in one polling district in one election. Available for 7 elections: GE-15, GE-14, GE-13, GE-12, JHR SE-16, N9 SE-15, and JHR SE-15. All variants share this schema.

Geography columns:

- `date`: Election date.
- `election`: Election identifier (e.g. `GE-15`, `SE-15`, `SE-16`). Note: both `saluran_ballots_nsn_se15` and `saluran_ballots_jhr_se15` have `election = 'SE-15'`; they are distinguished only by `state`. Always pair a state election table with a `state` filter.
- `state`: State name.
- `seat`: Seat identifier and name. Uses the same `P.` / non-`P.` convention as `headline_ballots`. For GE tables, `seat` is a Parliament seat; for SE tables, `seat` is a DUN seat.
- `dm`: Polling district code and name combined in a single string, for example `015/28/18 Taman Keladi`. The code portion follows the format `XXX/YY/ZZ`. Rows where `dm` contains `/UP` are postal votes.
- `pm`: Polling centre name, for example `Sekolah Menengah Sin Min (P), Sungai Petani`.
- `saluran`: Saluran number.

All other columns are exactly the same as in `headline_ballots`: `ballot_order`, `candidate_uid`, `name_on_ballot`, `name`, `sex`, `ethnicity`, `age`, `party_on_ballot`, `party_uid`, `party`, `coalition_uid`, `coalition`, `votes`, and `votes_perc`.

Note: `rank` and `result` are not available at saluran level.

## Dataset: `saluran_stats_*`

Each row represents saluran-level election statistics for one saluran in one polling district in one election. Available for the same 7 elections as `saluran_ballots_*`. All variants share this schema.

Columns:

- `date`: Election date.
- `election`: Election identifier.
- `state`: State name.
- `seat`: Seat identifier and name.
- `dm`: Polling district code and name combined (same format as `saluran_ballots_*`). Rows where `dm` contains `/UP` are postal votes.
- `pm`: Polling centre name.
- `saluran`: Saluran number.
- `voters_total`: Total registered voters in the saluran.
- `ballots_issued`: Ballots issued in the saluran.
- `ballots_not_returned`: Ballots not returned in the saluran.
- `votes_rejected`: Rejected votes in the saluran.
- `votes_valid`: Valid votes in the saluran.
- `voter_turnout`: Voter turnout percentage. Exclude rows where `dm` contains `/UP` (postal votes) when aggregating turnout.
- `votes_rejected_perc`: Rejected votes as a percentage of valid votes.
- `ballots_not_returned_perc`: Ballots not returned as a percentage of ballots issued.

## Dataset: `voter_demographics`

- `age_30_39`: Voters aged 30 to 39.
- `age_40_49`: Voters aged 40 to 49.
- `age_50_59`: Voters aged 50 to 59.
- `age_60_69`: Voters aged 60 to 69.
- `age_70_79`: Voters aged 70 to 79.

## Dataset: `voter_demographics_sarawak`

Each row represents seat-level voter demographic counts for one Sarawak Parliament or DUN seat. Covers GE-13, GE-14, and GE-15 for Sarawak seats only. Uses Sarawak-specific ethnic breakdowns instead of nationwide groupings.

Columns: `date`, `election`, `state`, `seat`, `voters_total`, `sex_male`, `sex_female`, all `age_*` columns (same as `voter_demographics`), `votertype_regular`, `votertype_early`, `votertype_postal_overseas`, plus:

## Dataset: `voter_demographics_sabah`

Each row represents seat-level voter demographic counts for one Sabah Parliament or DUN seat. Covers GE-13, GE-14, and GE-15 for Sabah seats only. Uses Sabah-specific ethnic breakdowns instead of nationwide groupings.

Columns: `date`, `election`, `state`, `seat`, `voters_total`, `sex_male`, `sex_female`, all `age_*` columns (same as `voter_demographics`), `votertype_regular`, `votertype_early`, `votertype_postal_overseas`, plus:

- `ethnic_malay`: Malay voters.

- `ethnic_other`: Other ethnicity voters.

## Dataset: `voter_roll_*`

Each row represents an anonymised voter in the voter roll with demographic fields and voting location. Available for 8 elections: GE-15, GE-14, GE-13, GE-12, N9 SE-16, JHR SE-16, N9 SE-15, and JHR SE-15. All variants share this schema. Note: `voter_roll_nsn_se16` has no corresponding `saluran_ballots_*` or `saluran_stats_*` table, so it cannot be joined to saluran-level data — use it standalone.

Columns:

- `uid`: Anonymised voter identifier.
- `birth_year`: Voter birth year. There is no `age` column — compute voter age as `YEAR(CAST(date AS DATE)) - birth_year` when joining to election data, or against a fixed reference year when working with the voter roll alone.
- `sex`: Voter sex. Possible values: `Male`, `Female` (note: unlike candidates which use `M`/`F`, voter roll uses full words).
- `ethnicity`: Voter ethnicity.
- `state`: State name.
- `parlimen`: Parliament seat identifier and name.
- `dun`: DUN seat identifier and name.
- `dm_vr`: Voter's residential polling district code and name (e.g. `001/01/05 Padang Besar`). This is where the voter is registered to live.
- `dm`: Voter's actual voting district code and name (e.g. `001/01/00 Undi Awal`). For early and postal voters this differs from `dm_vr`. This column matches the `dm` column in `saluran_ballots_*` and `saluran_stats_*`.
- `pm`: Polling centre name. Matches the `pm` column in `saluran_ballots_*` and `saluran_stats_*`.
- `saluran`: Saluran number.

## Join Rules

When joining `headline_ballots` and `headline_stats`, join on all of these columns:

- `date`
- `election`
- `state`
- `seat`

Do not join only on `seat`, because seat names may repeat or change meaning across elections, states, or dates.

When joining `saluran_ballots_*` and `saluran_stats_*`, join on all of these columns:

- `date`
- `election`
- `state`
- `seat`
- `dm`
- `pm`
- `saluran`

When joining `voter_demographics` to results or ballots, join on all of these columns:

- `date`
- `election`
- `state`
- `seat`

When joining `voter_roll_*` to `saluran_ballots_*` or `saluran_stats_*`:

`voter_roll_*` and the saluran tables are perfectly aligned at the saluran level. The join key is always `dm`, `pm`, and `saluran` — these three columns together uniquely identify a saluran and match exactly between the voter roll and saluran tables. No additional seat column is needed for the join itself. This join is not available for `voter_roll_nsn_se16`, since there are no corresponding `saluran_ballots_*` or `saluran_stats_*` tables for N9 SE-16.

- To scope the join to a Parliament seat: also filter on `voter_roll_*.parlimen = saluran_*.seat`
- To scope the join to a DUN seat: also filter on `voter_roll_*.dun = saluran_*.seat`

Aggregate `voter_roll_*` rows first (e.g. count voters by ethnicity or age group per saluran), then join the aggregated result to `saluran_stats_*` or `saluran_ballots_*` on `dm`, `pm`, and `saluran`.

## Election Filtering Rules

For general elections, filter using:

```sql
election LIKE 'GE%'
```

For state elections, filter using:

```sql
election LIKE 'SE%'
AND state = '<state name>'
```

State election questions should include a specific state filter unless the user explicitly asks for all state elections across all states.

To exclude by-elections from `headline_ballots` or `headline_stats`, filter using:

```sql
election != 'BY-ELECTION'
```

## Grouping Rules

Any grouping, ranking, counting, or aggregation involving candidates, parties, or coalitions should use their stable UID columns.

Use:

- `candidate_uid` for candidates
- `party_uid` for parties
- `coalition_uid` for coalitions

Use the UID columns for grouping logic, but do not display UIDs in the final results unless the user explicitly asks for them. UIDs are stable identifiers, but they are not meaningful to most users. Display readable columns such as `name`, `party`, and `coalition` instead.

Examples:

- Group candidates by `candidate_uid`, but display `name`.
- Group parties by `party_uid`, but display `party` and, where useful, `coalition`.
- Group coalitions by `coalition_uid`, but display `coalition`.

This matters because names and labels can vary across elections, languages, spelling conventions, or ballot formatting.

## Coalition Dictionary

When filtering or comparing coalitions, use the exact `coalition` code values from the data, not expanded English or Malay names. For example, use `coalition = 'PH'`, not `coalition = 'Pakatan Harapan'`.

When grouping coalitions, use `coalition_uid` (a string such as `'007-PH'`). Note that successor coalitions share the same numeric prefix: `001-PERIKATAN` and `001-BN` are both the ruling Alliance lineage; `007-BA`, `007-PR`, and `007-PH` are all the opposition coalition lineage.

| 015-GTA | GTA | Gerakan Tanah Air | 2022 | 2022 |

## Party Dictionary

When filtering or comparing parties, use the exact `party` code from the data (e.g. `party = 'DAP'`). When grouping parties across elections, use `party_uid` for stability — some parties have changed abbreviations under the same UID (e.g. `009-PR` → `009-PSRM` → `009-PRM`).

## Important Analysis Notes

- `headline_ballots` is candidate-level.
- `headline_stats` is seat-level.
- `saluran_ballots_*` is candidate-level at saluran granularity. Available for 7 elections only: GE-15, GE-14, GE-13, GE-12, JHR SE-16, N9 SE-15, JHR SE-15.
- `saluran_stats_*` is saluran-level. Same 7 elections.
- `voter_roll_*` covers 8 elections: the same 7 as `saluran_ballots_*`, plus N9 SE-16 (voter roll only — no saluran-level data, so it cannot be joined to saluran tables).
- `voter_demographics` is seat-level. Available for GE-13, GE-14, and GE-15 (all seats, nationwide), plus Johor SE-15 and SE-16, and Negeri Sembilan SE-16 (state-specific seats). Johor SE-16 and Negeri Sembilan SE-16 demographics are fully available.
- Use `voter_demographics` instead of the raw voter roll for requests involving only one demographic dimension, such as sex only, ethnicity only, or age only.
- The `voter_demographics` columns do not provide demographic cross-tabs. For requests involving two or more demographic dimensions, such as men aged 18-20, use `voter_roll_*`.
- `voter_demographics` columns are absolute counts. In general, convert them into percentages for analysis unless the user explicitly asks for absolute counts. For example, if the user asks to see results in the Parliament seats with the highest percentage of Chinese voters, compute `ethnic_chinese * 100.0 / voters_total` from `voter_demographics`, then compare it with results.
- `voter_roll_*` should be used for voter-level demographic work that cannot be answered from `voter_demographics`, especially cross-tabs involving two or more demographic dimensions.
- `voter_roll_*` is perfectly aligned with `saluran_ballots_*` and `saluran_stats_*` at the saluran level. See Join Rules for the correct join pattern. This enables saluran-level demographic analysis — for example, computing the ethnic or age composition of each saluran and correlating it with votes or turnout.
- In `voter_roll_*`, `dm` is the voter's actual voting district (matches saluran tables), while `dm_vr` is their residential district. Always join to saluran tables using `dm`, not `dm_vr`.
- Be careful not to double-count seat-level values from `headline_stats` after joining to candidate-level rows in `headline_ballots`.
- Be careful not to double-count saluran-level values from `saluran_stats_*` after joining to candidate-level rows in `saluran_ballots_*`.
- If aggregating seat-level statistics after a join, deduplicate at the seat-election level first using `date`, `election`, `state`, and `seat`.
- `saluran_stats_*` includes pre-computed `voter_turnout`, `votes_rejected_perc`, and `ballots_not_returned_perc` columns. Exclude rows where `dm` contains `/UP` (postal votes) when aggregating `voter_turnout`.
- The Malaysian electoral geography is a strict nesting: **Parlimen > DUN > DM > PM > Saluran**. Every saluran belongs to exactly one PM, every PM to exactly one DM, every DM to exactly one DUN, and every DUN to exactly one Parlimen. This perfect nesting means saluran data can be aggregated upward to any level without overlap or double-counting. For example, summing `votes` from `saluran_ballots_ge15` grouped by `seat` + `candidate_uid` reproduces Parliament-level results exactly. To aggregate to a level not present in the saluran table (e.g. DUN-level results from a GE, or Parliament-level results from a state election), join the saluran data to `voter_roll_*` on `dm`, `pm`, and `saluran` to obtain the `dun` (or `parlimen`) for each saluran, then group and sum. This allows estimating what the DUN results would have been in GE-15, or estimating Parliament-level results from JHR SE-15 saluran data.
- For questions about voter demographics in **Sarawak seats**, offer the user a choice: (a) use `voter_demographics` with nationwide groupings (Malay, Chinese, Indian, Bumi Sarawak, etc.), or (b) use `voter_demographics_sarawak` with Sarawak-specific groupings (Malay/Melanau, Chinese, Iban, Bidayuh, Orang Ulu, Kedayan, Other Bumi Sarawak, Other). Use whichever the user prefers.
- For questions about voter demographics in **Sabah seats**, offer the user a choice: (a) use `voter_demographics` with nationwide groupings, or (b) use `voter_demographics_sabah` with Sabah-specific groupings (Malay, Chinese, Kadazan-Dusun, Bajau, Murut, Brunei, Sungai, Other Bumi Sabah, Other). Use whichever the user prefers.
- `won_uncontested` indicates an uncontested seat. These may have `votes = 0`, blank `votes_perc`, and seat stats such as `ballots_issued = 0`.
- `votes_perc`, `voter_turnout`, `majority_perc`, `votes_rejected_perc`, and `ballots_not_returned_perc` are percentages, not proportions.
- Blank percentage fields should be treated as missing values.
- `age = -1` should be treated as unknown or missing, not as a real age.
- `party_on_ballot` and `coalition` may reflect historical ballot labels. For consistent grouping, use `party_uid` and `coalition_uid`.
- `BEBAS` / `000-BEBAS` represents independent candidates.
- `ALONE` / `000-ALONE` represents parties or candidates not running under a broader coalition.
- A "seat won" should usually be counted from `headline_ballots` where `result` is `won` or `won_uncontested`.
- Candidate vote totals and vote shares should come from `headline_ballots`.
- Turnout, rejected votes, valid votes, majority, and registered voters should come from `headline_stats`.
- If calculating national or state totals, take care with uncontested seats and missing/zero ballot statistics.

## Answerability

If my question likely cannot be answered from these datasets, tell me clearly.

For example, say so if the question requires information that is not present, such as campaign spending, polling data, incumbency, constituency boundaries, demographic composition of voters, party manifestos, or candidate biographies beyond the columns listed above.

Where possible, suggest the closest answerable version of the question using the available fields.
